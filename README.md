# EDA-Covid


										
### Overview
In this Jupyter notebook, we will perform EDA on the Corona Virus dataset which contains datewise entries of 188 countries, specifying their latitude, longitude, type of cases and the number of cases recorded on that day. The dataset has entries from 22nd January 2020 to 27th July 2020.

### Analysis
From this EDA, we can answer questions like:-

<li>Which are the 5 most affected countries in the world?</li>
<li>Does latitude and longitude affect the amount of cases?</li>
<li>Which country has the highest death and recovery rate?</li>
<li>Which date of every month recorded the highest number of cases in the world?</li>
<li>Are the different parameters dependent on each other? (using corelation heatmaps)</li>

### Data Visualization
The graphs are also plotted for data visualization, using the Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries.

### Requirements
<li>Python 2.7 or higher</li>
<li>Jupyter Notebook pip install notebook</li>
<li>Pandas pip install pandas</li>
<li>Numpy pip install numpy</li>
<li>Seaborn pip intall seaborn</li>
<li>Matplotlib pip install matplotlib</li>
